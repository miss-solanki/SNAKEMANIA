# SNAKEMANIA

****   The snake game in JavaScript: In this, we will be able to see how we can code the very famous slither aka snake game in javascript. Slither can be coded using a very basic logic which is presented throughout the code. This using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript.


****   The game involves controlling a single block or snakehead by turning only left or right by ninety degrees until you manage to eat the food. When you get the food, the Snake grows an extra block or body segment.

****   If, or rather when, the snake bumps into the edge of the screen or accidentally eats himself the game is over. The more food the snake eats the higher the score.
